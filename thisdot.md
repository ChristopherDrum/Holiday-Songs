# I Don't Want This Dot for Christmas

*(to the tune of I Don't Want a Lot for Christmas)*

```
I don't want this dot for Christmas.
There is just one var I need.
I don't care about the syntax.
Or the wasted memory.

I just want my sketch to play
more than you could ever say.
Let's try Java mode. 
All I want for Christmas is code.

I don't want this dot for Christmas.
There is just one boolean I need.
I'm just gonna keep on looping
Until I run out of memory.

I won't make a linked list and send it
Without the use of websockets.

I won't even stay awake to
try debugging with an IDE.

I just want my code to sing
More than you want machine learning.

Maybe it'll work with Node?
All I want for Christmas is code.

yeah curly bracket, closed parentheses.
```
